\section{Background}

Chicago's Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax (PPLTT) applies to AI subscription services including ChatGPT Plus. The tax rate increased from 9\% (October 2023) to 11\% (January 2025).

\section{Pass-Through Evidence}

Figure~\ref{fig:price} shows the median transaction amount for ChatGPT subscriptions in Chicago (zip3 606). The base ChatGPT Plus price is \$20/month. Full pass-through would imply prices of \$21.80 at 9\% and \$22.20 at 11\%.

    \label{fig:price}
\end{figure}

Observed median prices are slightly below full pass-through (\$21.36 vs \$21.80 during the 9\% period; \$21.95 vs \$22.20 during the 11\% period), suggesting pass-through is high but not complete.

\section{Quantity Effects}

\subsection{Raw Time Series}

Figure~\ref{fig:raw} compares log transactions in Chicago to the simple mean of 93 size-matched control zip3s. Controls are selected as zip3s with transaction counts within 50\% of Chicago's count during January--June 2023.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Event Study}

We do two specifications, one with all transactions, and one that restricts to transactions between \$15--25, which isolates ChatGPT Plus subscriptions (\$20 base price plus tax variation across jurisdictions). This excludes API usage and large enterprise purchases, dropping about 6\% of transactions. The sample runs from March 2023 through November 2024. We drop February 2023 (the ChatGPT Plus launch month) because early adoption patterns differ sharply across regions, creating spurious pre-trend violations.

Figure~\ref{fig:did} presents event study estimates from a difference-in-differences specification:
\[
\log(\text{transactions}_{zt}) = \sum_{\tau \neq \text{Sep 2023}} \beta_\tau \cdot \mathbf{1}[\text{Chicago}] \cdot \mathbf{1}[\text{month} = \tau] + \alpha_z + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{zt}
\]
Standard errors are clustered at the zip3 level.

\section{Discussion}

The evidence suggests:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pass-through is high but slightly incomplete
    \item Quantity declined relative to controls, with the effect growing at higher tax rates
    \item Implied elasticity is around $-1$ if we believe these estimates
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Elasticity interpretation.} We observe transaction prices in all zip3s but do not know the underlying tax rates. The elasticity calculation uses Chicago's known tax rate (9\%) as the price change, implicitly assuming control prices remained constant. If control zip3s also experienced price increases, the true elasticity would be smaller in magnitude.

\paragraph{Potential confound: employer-paid subscriptions.} ChatGPT Enterprise launched in August 2023 (\$60/user/month, 150-seat minimum). ChatGPT Team launched in January 2024 (\$25--30/user/month). If Chicago employers (e.g., University of Chicago) adopted enterprise licenses in late 2023 or early 2024, affected users would disappear from personal credit card data---either because billing shifted to corporate accounts, or because the per-seat price exceeds our \$15--25 filter. This would produce a Chicago-specific decline unrelated to the tax. The timing of our observed decline (emerging around early 2024, growing through the year) is consistent with gradual enterprise rollout.
